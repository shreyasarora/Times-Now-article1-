This would sync better with their typical exit timelines of 7-10 years.Content:\nThe report said that vacancy levels for Grade A offices are in a low-to-moderate range across cities.\n\"This will work in favour of commercial lease rentals, which we believe, are likely to escalate at 5-10 per cent per annum over the next 2-3 years,\" it said.Content:\nCrisil, however, noted that given the high level of compliance and stringent regulatory requirements for REITs, developers with smaller commercial portfolios would continue to use lease rental discounting loans, which are accessible at rates as low as nine per cent.Content:\n\"Furthermore, developers who prefer to retain the capital appreciation opportunity and not dilute their stake, will not prefer the REIT route,\" the report said.Content:\nHow does\u00a0Tamal\u00a0Bandyopadhyay\u00a0& VG Kannan assess the situation in the BFSI space? Bandyopadhyay believes that the root of the problem in NBFC is the\u00a0 real estate sector & VG Kannan says that one solution to this problem could be to complete real estate projects in a timely manner.\u00a0\n\n\nRelated
